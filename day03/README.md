**Part 1: 2D**

Represented the data as dense 2D array in order to get columnar statistics for the gamma rate. Then we use bitwise XOR to get the epsilon. Wanted to do a counter dictionary but... too troublesome.

**Part 2: Recursion**

Used recursion for each gamma and epsilon rating, and stop when there is only one number left.
