**Recursion**

Solved this initially using recursion and mutating the initial state *d* times 😱 where *d* is the number of days. This worked for the first part but in the second part the process got killed 🤭. Both space and time complexity possibly exponential.

**DP**

Really thought it was a DP problem (since I started with recursion) so I dwelled on it.

**Deque**

But later realised that it can be solved using a deque. Space *O(1)*. Time *O(d)*.
