**Recursion**

Solved this initially using recursion and mutating the initial state $d$ times ðŸ˜± where $d$ is the number of days. This worked for the first part but in the second part the process got killed ðŸ¤­. Both space and time complexity possibly exponential.

**DP**

Really thought it was a DP problem (since I started with recursion) so I dwelled on it.

**Deque**

But later realised that it can be solved using a deque. Space $O(1)$.
Time $O(d)$.
